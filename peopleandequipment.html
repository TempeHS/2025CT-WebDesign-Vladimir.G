            <p>World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945, was a global conflict that involved
                most of the world's nations, including
                all of the great powers. It was the most widespread war in history and directly involved more
                than 100 million people
                from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and
                scientific capabilities
                behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. The war
                began on September 1,
                1939, when Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. This act prompted Britain and France to
                declare war on Germany.
                The conflict had several root causes, including the Treaty of Versailles' harsh terms imposed on
                Germany after World War
                I, economic instability during the Great Depression, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in
                Germany, Italy, and Japan.
                </br><br>
                The war saw significant fighting in multiple theaters. In Europe, Germany quickly conquered much
                of Western Europe using
                a tactic known as Blitzkrieg or "lightning war," which involved rapid, surprise attacks. The
                largest and dead
                liest theater of the war was the Eastern Front, where Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union engaged
                in brutal combat after
                Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. In the Pacific, the conflict was dominated
                by the struggle between
                Japan and the Allies, primarily the United States. This theater saw significant naval battles,
                island-hopping campaigns,
                and harsh combat conditions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column right" style="background-color:#E5E4E2;">
            <p>Key events of the war included Germany's swift conquests in 1940, including
                the fall
                of France and the Battle of
                Britain, where the UK successfully resisted German air assaults. The war expanded
                dramatically
                in 1941 with Operation
                Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and the Japanese attack on Pearl
                Harbor,
                which brought the United
                States into the conflict. The Allies began to turn the tide in 1942-1943 with pivotal
                victories
                such as the Battle of
                Midway in the Pacific and the Battle of Stalingrad on the Eastern Front. In 1944, D-Day
                marked a
                significant turning
                point as Allied forces landed in Normandy, France, beginning the liberation of Western
                Europe.
                The war in Europe ended
                in May 1945 with Germany's surrender following Hitler's suicide. In the Pacific, the war
                concluded after the United
                States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, leading to Japan's
                surrender on September 2, 1945.
                </br><br>
                The consequences of World War II were profound and far-reaching. Over 70 million people
                died,
                including six million Jews
                who were murdered in the Holocaust. The war led to significant geopolitical changes,
                including
                the establishment of the
                United Nations to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts. It also
                set the
                stage for the Cold War
                between the United States and the Soviet Union. Economically, many European and Asian
                countries
                were left in ruins,
                necessitating extensive rebuilding efforts such as the Marshall Plan in Europe. World
                War II
                reshaped the global order,
                leading to significant changes in political boundaries, economic systems, and
                international
                relations.</p>
