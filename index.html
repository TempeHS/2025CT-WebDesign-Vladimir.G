    <h1>Italian food</h1>
    <p>The Italian peninsula is packed with diverse culinary cultures which produce different Italian dishes. For
        instance,
        Sicily produces seafood dishes while Tuscany is best known for its simple yet rustic specials.

        Other nationalities from different countries have also adopted the Italian food tradition and have even become a
        staple
        food on their tables. For example, Americans are very much in love with pizza and pasta which is a popular
        Italian dish.

        Additionally, Italian food culture uses distinct ingredients for all of their dishes such as tomato, eggplant,
        pasta,
        cured meats, and cheese. You must not forget about the sweet Italian desserts that will surely conclude your
        meal with a
        bang.

        Italian food culture has influenced a lot of countries already. It is known to captivate the taste buds of so
        many
        people from different cultures around the world. Thus, these people adopted what they liked about Italian food
        and added
        locally grown ingredients and incorporated them into their own traditional dishes, and made them their own.

        The most important aspect that you must know about the Italian food culture is that their authentic dishes are
        only made
        with a few ingredients. However, these ingredients are carefully chosen and if the ingredient is not the
        freshest it can
        be they will not buy it but substitute for better quality or not make the dish at all. Each ingredient must
        shine since
        there are only a few ingredients..</p>

    <h1>Why the cuisine is special</h1>
    <p>Once you’ve seen an Italian chef or home cook create an Italian dish, you will automatically notice that the
        ingredients
        used in cooking are nothing but fresh. The Italian food culture focuses more on choosing fresh, quality
        ingredients than
        on intricate preparations.
    <h2>How did the Italian cuisine be popularised outside of Europe</h2>
    <p>The mass migration of Italians to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries further popularized
        Italian cuisine. Italians brought with them Italian street food such as pizza and pasta, which also soon became
        hugely
        popular on the streets of the United States. Italians also brought with them bread recipes, such as focaccia and
        Chianina bread, and how to prepare them with thin slices of ham, peppers or cuts of chicken in the form of a
        sandwich,
        which later became popular as a submarine. The British also incorporated Italian ingredients into their diet,
        which
        included everything from pasta, black pepper and salads to pine nuts, lemon juice, pesto and olive oil - as well
        as
        pizza, of course! Indeed, if you take a trip to a British supermarket these days, don't be surprised to find a
        tin of
        minestrone or a jar of pesto next to the leek and potato soup, or a tiramisu next to the apple crumble.
        Meanwhile, both
        their red and white wines are a cut above and enjoy huge success, being exported throughout the world.
    </p>

    Italy is a pretty diverse country and every region offers different fresh produce that makes it readily
    available
    throughout Italy. From fresh eggs to oil, vegetables, meat, fish, herbs, and cheeses, Italian food is all about
    the
    freshness of all the ingredients they put into their dishes.</p>

    <h1>Why is the cuisine so simple</h1>
    <p>Like what was mentioned earlier, Italian cuisines are more attentive to how fresh their ingredients are and not
        the
        recipe’s complexity. Typical Italian food only requires a few ingredients to create and this is what makes
        Italians
        amazing.

        They can do a lot of wonders with such little ingredients and no one will ever notice. This is how talented they
        are
        when it comes to crafting a dish. Cooking is considered a work of art or craft by most Italian and almost
        everyone in
        Italy knows how to cook.

        Simplicity in Italian cuisine goes a very long way. As long as the ingredients are freshly chosen and the
        tradition,
        intention, and love are present, you will surely create a marvelous Italian dish..</p>
    <h2>The history</h2>
    <p>The history of Italian cuisine is rooted from generation to generation for each Italian family. Italian people
        care so
        much about their family’s cooking history that recipes are being passed from one generation to the other by word
        of
        mouth. However, as the old get older and the young are not interested until later some have taken to documenting
        the
        recipes which is a plus to history and readily available to the world via the internet.

        It is then the responsibility of the new generation to preserve the traditional recipes and pass them on to the
        young
        ones. However, in the general view of the entire Italian food culture, everything started from the ancestors of
        Italy.

        The Romans, which are the greatest ancestors of Italy, adored food so much. Back in the day, Romans loved to
        feast on
        food, organizing banquet after banquet just to taste the wonders of the Italian dishes. This is also the best
        time to
        serve and introduce new dishes to the table for everyone to try and judge. Rifugioâ€™s Country Italian Cuisine
        has taken
        this theme and creates feasts based loosely on seasonal events of Italy like â€œThe Feast of the Seven Fishesâ€
        or
        â€œThe Feast of Saint Francis in honor of their ancestors.

        The Roman empire accepted the flavors of all the ingredients from the places they have conquered. They enjoyed
        how the
        spices from the Middle East have enhanced their classic Italian favorites. Romans also started to introduce
        cereals that
        they acquired from North Africa and served them on their Italian tables.

        If today Italian dishes are only made with fewer ingredients, at the time of the Roman Empire, all their recipes
        are
        nothing less than elaborate. From the sophisticated food preparation techniques to intricate choice of
        ingredients.

        This is the reality of the Italian food culture back in the days, especially if you are cooking for the rich and
        famous
        families in ancient Rome. You must ensure that what you put on their table is the best and nothing less.
        However,
        ordinary people still stick to food that suits their living status which is usually a three-ingredient recipe.

        Wine, olive oil, and cereals are the most common ingredients Romans used in their simple everyday meal which the
        current
        Italian people still use up to this date.

        When the Barbarians came into the picture, the Roman Empire along with its traditions had come to an end.
        Traditions
        from both cultures clash with each other which resulted in one culture influencing the other and vice versa
        especially
        when it came to food.

        Romans are known to possess sophistication while Barbarians are referred to as harsh-speaking and rugged-looking
        people.
        These newcomers introduced beer and butter to the Romans, while the Romans taught the Barbarians about wines and
        the use
        of olive oil.

        In Sicily on the other hand, during the middle ages, the region was colonized by Arabs which influenced their
        culture
        and introduced the use of spices and dried fruits to the region. This Arabic influence can still be found in the
        modern-day dishes from Sicily.

        Contrary to what everyone assumed, dried pasta does not originate in Italy. It was just brought to Italy by
        Arabs as
        they found it easier to transport and preserve, which is suitable for their long journeys at sea.

        Religion also had a huge impact on how people in Italy eat. When Christianity was introduced, it greatly impacts
        how
        people in Italy choose their ingredients. The history of Italian food is a long topic to talk about and there
        are so
        many things in and around it that need to be tackled to better cover the entire history of Italian food.</p>
