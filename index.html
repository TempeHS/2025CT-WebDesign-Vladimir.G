    <h1>Italian food</h1>
    <p>The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables. Cheese,
        cold cuts and wine are central to Italian cuisine, and along with pizza and coffee (especially espresso) form
        part of Italian gastronomic culture.</p>

    <h1>Why the cuisine is special</h1>
    <p>The greatest aspect of Italian food is its bold flavor combinations. Fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, garlic,
        onions, basil, oregano, rosemary, and olive oil are common in classic Italian dishes.</p>

    <h1>Why is the cuisine so simple</h1>
    <p>Respect for Tradition: Italian cuisine is deeply rooted in tradition and regional variations. Traditional recipes
        are often passed down through generations, preserving authentic flavors and techniques. This respect for
        tradition helps maintain the simplicity and taste of Italian food.</p>
